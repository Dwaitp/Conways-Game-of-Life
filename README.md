# Conway's game of life clone!
My python3 pygame based implementation of Conway's game of life. 

![Gif demonstration which for some reason has gone for good T_T](https://i.ibb.co/PW1McT7/Preview.gif)

# The good thing

is that you can use your own sprites. Just check the Life folder: Sprites from 1 to 10 are numbers, indices for the tilemap. 10.png is a left upper corner tile, others sprites are self-explanatory. If you want to use your own sprites, don't forget to change the tile_size in the code, please, in case you use not the 16x16 format.

# The controls

**Click** on cell to change its state of being,
Press **J** to speed up the game and **K** to do the opposite.
Press **Space** to pause or continue the game.

# Requirements

- python-tk / python3-tk
- pygame
